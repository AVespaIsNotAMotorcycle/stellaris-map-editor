# stellaris-map-editor

An editor for static maps in Stellaris. It was written in C# via Unity in late 2020 - early 2021.
Allows the placement of systems, hyperlanes, and nebulae, as well as defining the game settings.
Does not allow the user to define the content of those systems; those are randomly generated on game start.

There are built versions ready to go for Mac and Windows in the Builds folder.
Additionally, you can open the project in Unity.
